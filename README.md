# QA DevOps Bootcamp – Jenkins + Docker + CI/CD

A practical CI/CD automation project integrating QA test execution into Jenkins pipelines running in Docker containers.  
Developed as part of my hands-on DevOps journey using KodeKloud labs and real QA tools.

> Focus: CI/CD workflows, containerized test runs, and continuous quality integration.
